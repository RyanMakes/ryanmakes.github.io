These are the PDF copies of the show's printed materials:
 - [Show Bio](/doingthelordswork/malloshowbio.pdf)
 - [Show Pamphlet](/doingthelordswork/malloshowpamphlet.pdf)

 I feel I owe the public pictures and titles and statements for the pieces not covered in the pamphlet, so I'll be updating them here as I get them written.

 For now, consider it a game! Can you match the titles here to the pieces on display?

 Pieces:
  - The Pioneer Plaque & Voyager Golden Record
  - Eratosthenes' demonstration of the curvature and circumference of Terra
  - The Angel Of Death
  - Lucifer Morningstar
  - Galileo Galilei
  - Daydreamasaurus herd
  - Laser engraved Mallo mug inside the laser machine
  - Many fidgets!
