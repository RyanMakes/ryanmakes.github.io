With Danassist's help, I have realized that keeping a dev blog is okay,
but publishing it with rm.ca is not necessary. We will move what we should to the colophon but call it the making-of ?? or something commonly legible, and then logs will be unlisted in the mdbook. or include colophon in the glossary?

logs moved out of the /src folder now.

thanks!
